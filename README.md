## Overview
**Find My Spot** is a computer vision and IoT-based application designed to help users locate the nearest parking space.  This project was developed as an MVP during a hackathon, where our team leveraged advanced computer vision technology and IoT solutions to create an innovative system.
We are proud to share a photo of our application in action at York University. Using computer vision technology, our app analyzed vacant parking lots and informed users of available parking spots in real-time. Despite numerous challenges faced during the development process, we are thrilled with the outcome and its potential to improve people's lives.

## Key Functionalities
1. **ESP32 Camera Stream with Face Detection and Recognition**
   - Uses the ESP32 microcontroller to create a web server for streaming video and performing face recognition.
2. **YOLOv5-based License Plate Detection**
   - Leverages the YOLOv5 object detection model to identify and locate license plates in images.
3. **Real-Time Parking Space Analysis**
   - Integrates computer vision to analyze parking lot availability and provide real-time updates to users.
4. **Garage Parking Sharing**
   - Allows users to view and share garage parking spaces through the application.

## Features
### ESP32 Camera Stream
- Streams video over a web interface using the ESP32 microcontroller.
- Supports face detection and recognition with enrollment and identification capabilities.
- Provides an HTTP API for image capture, configuration, and status retrieval.

### YOLOv5 License Plate Detection
- Uses the pre-trained YOLOv5 model for detecting license plates in images.
- Visualizes detected bounding boxes directly on the provided image.
- Supports GUI-based image selection and result display using Tkinter and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

## Usage

### Face Detection and Recognition (ESP32)
1. Open the stream endpoint in your browser to start streaming.
2. Use the `/control` endpoint to enable or disable face detection and recognition.
3. Enroll new faces using the `/control?var=face_enroll&val=1` endpoint.
4. View live recognition results in the stream.

### License Plate Detection (YOLOv5)
1. Run the `server.py` script in the `yolov5` folder.
2. Open the browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
3. Upload an image containing license plates.
4. The results with bounding boxes will be displayed on the webpage.
